# Tutorial
*This document helps beginners taste the basic functions of `O20k` step by step.*  

- The full souce code of the related repo of the tools is [here](../src/omniverse-swap-tools/). The original souce code repo is [here](https://github.com/virgil2019/omniverse-swap-tools)
- The EVM tools can be found [here](https://github.com/virgil2019/omniverse-evm/tree/feature-substrate-no-payload/contracts), and remember to go there to execute EVM related operetions. This will be integrated into a whole tool.  
- In this stage, we have designed and made out an intuitive [prototype](https://github.com/xiyu1984/o-amm/blob/main/solving.py) of the Omniverse AMM algorithm.  
- Besides, we also provide an [on-chain prototype](https://github.com/xiyu1984/O-AMM-ParaSim) for the `off-chain calculation, and on-chain verification` based on a specific verifiable computation, which can be tested manually through an [operation tutorial](https://github.com/xiyu1984/O-AMM-ParaSim/tree/main/off-chain-calc).

### Connection
The Parachain of `O20k` is deployed at `ws://3.74.157.177:9944`, and we recommand using [Polkadot.js](https://polkadot.js.org/apps/#/explorer) to connect to it.  
![img](./assets/connection.png)
<p align='center'>Figure.1 Connect to `O20k` Parachain</p>  

If succeed, you can find the related pallets at [Extrinsics](https://polkadot.js.org/apps/#/extrinsics):  
![img](./assets/connection%20succeed.png)  

### Deployment
To make it convenient, we have already deployed two kinds of Omniverse Tokens, token $X$ and token $Y$, which have been already registered onto the pallet of the Omniverse swap on the `O20k` Parachain of Polkadot.  

<!-- ***Note that the precision of the Omniverse tokens is $10^{0}$.*** -->

#### Parachain of `O20k`
* Pallet `OmniverseFactory` is mainly used to make transactions:  
    * The `tokenId` of Token $X$ is `X`
    * The `tokenId` of Token $Y$ is `Y`
* Pallet `OmniverseSwap` is mainly used to make exchanges:
    * The `tradingPair` of the specific swapping pool is `X2Y`.

#### EVM chains
The Omniverse tokens are also deployed as smart contracts on some EVM chains.  
- BSCTEST:
    - "X": [0x2fea6b82bAd2999C8Abb0C072363f86f2add5292](https://testnet.bscscan.com/address/0x2fea6b82bAd2999C8Abb0C072363f86f2add5292),
    - "Y": [0x069c23c166Edff0398958C261D3968713B21139c](https://testnet.bscscan.com/address/0x069c23c166Edff0398958C261D3968713B21139c),

## Tools Install
The Omniverse operation tools can be found [here](https://github.com/virgil2019/omniverse-swap-tools).  
* Go to the [repo of the tools](../src//omniverse-swap-tools/).
* If you do not clone the whole hackathon repo, you can just clone the repo [here](https://github.com/virgil2019/omniverse-swap-tools/tree/main). 
* Install the dependent packages.  
    ```sh
    npm install
    ```
* The explanation of the commands.
    ```sh
    node index.js --help
    ```

## Omniverse Account
Omniverse operations are all based on the Omniverse account, which is equivalent to the native address on each chain and is interconvertible. When making an operation on a concrete chain(e.g. `O20k` Parachain on Polkadot), we can use the original Polkadot account/address or the Omniverse account. It's transparent for users.  
Currently, we have made a specific tool to operate Omniverse Account.  
* [Create Account](#create-account)
* [Check the Account](#check-the-account)

### Create Account
As we mentioned before, the Omniverse account is equivalent to the native account. We can create an new account through the [Polkadot.js/apps](https://polkadot.js.org/apps/#/accounts)
![img](./assets/create%20account.png)  
<p align='center'>Figure.2 Create an Omniverse account through Polkadot.js/apps</p>  

***Note that***:  
1. Choose `Raw seed`
2. Choose `ECDSA (Non BTC/ETH compatible)` in `keypair crypto type`
3. Record the value of the `secret seed`, which will be used in the Omniverse account tool.

#### Get Gas Tokens
Before using the new account created by [Create Account](#create-account) in the `Omniverse Tools` below, you need to get some gas tokens first as shown in *Figure.3*.  
* Use the default account `Alice` of the Parachain to send some gas tokens to your new account directly.
![img](./assets/get%20gas%20token.png)  
<p align='center'>Figure.3 Get some Gas Tokens</p>  


### Check the Account
You can check the information of the account with the `secret seed` mentioned at [previous chapter](#create-account).  
* Create a new file named `.secret` at the same path of [.secret-example](../src/omniverse-swap-tools/omniverse-helper/.secret-example), and set the `secret seed` in it, the content of which is something as below:  
    ```json
    {
        "sks": [
            "b4c88b446aa0923be87ca6e02e4c767bd6xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx",
            "a4c88b446aa0923be87ca6e02e4c767bd6xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx"
        ],
        "index": 0,
        "mpc": "0x9b0bc430a57fbfab286eaeffd22d1f05bc415c6f3c19d4c4880c3e1f80e5a7a65e36a3f960adda4670a690098a10ad98f03111d4085a937325aa468072dcf294"
    }
    ```
    * `sks` are secret keys of the Omniverse Accounts. Normally, we need to create two keys that one is the sender and the other is the receiver, as we will do [Omniverse Transferring](#make-transaction-of-omniverse-token) later.
    * `index` means which account is used to make transactions, which starts from `0` and it is related to the first secret key in `sks`.
    * `mpc` is the abstract account of the Swap, and just copy it into your `.secret` file as above.  

* Check the information of your account with the command below:  
    ```sh
    # command to get the account information, including:
    # Omniverse Account
    # account on Polkadot
    # account on EVM chains
    # @ -a, --account
    node index.js -a
    ```
    * You may see something as follows:  
![img](./assets/get-account-info.png)  

## Omniverse Token Protocol
The operations related to the Omniverse Token Protocol(`OTP`) include `Claim`, `balance of`, and `transfer`.  
* [Claim](#claim)
* [Check the balance](#check-the-balance)
* [Transaction](#make-transaction-of-omniverse-token)
    * [Initiate a transaction](#initiate-the-omiverse-transaction)
    <!-- * [Initiate on EVM chains](#initiate-transaction-on-evm-chains) -->

### Claim
* `Claim` Token $X$ to operation Account:  
    ```sh
    # -c, --claim <tokenId>
    node index.js -c X
    ```
* `Claim` Token $Y$ to operation Account:
    ```sh
    # -c, --claim <tokenId>
    node index.js -c Y
    ```

### Check the balance
#### Check balance on Polkadot
* Check `balance of` Token $X$ of related account on Polkadot:  
    ```sh
    # -o, --omniBalance <tokenId>,<omniverse account>
    node index.js -o X,0x256077...
    ```
    * `X` is the tokenId mentioned [above](#parachain-of-o20k).  
    * `0x256077...` is the Omniverse Account got by [-a/--account](#check-the-account).  
    * **Note that** there is `,` between the paremeters.  

* Check `balance of` Token $Y$ of related account on Polkadot:  
    ```sh
    # -o, --omniBalance <tokenId>,<omniverse account>
    node index.js -o Y,0x256077...
    ```

#### Check balance on EVM chains
* Go to [EVM tools path](https://github.com/virgil2019/omniverse-evm/tree/feature-substrate-no-payload/contracts) first, and follow the tutorial to check what happened on EVM. 

* Check `balance of` Token $X$ of related account on EVM chains:  
    * [Block Scan](https://testnet.bscscan.com/address/0x2fea6b82bAd2999C8Abb0C072363f86f2add5292)
* Check `balance of` Token $Y$ of related account on EVM chains:  
    * [Block Scan](https://testnet.bscscan.com/address/0x069c23c166Edff0398958C261D3968713B21139c)

### Make transaction of Omniverse Token
#### Initiate the Omiverse transaction
* Transfer Token $X$ to another account on Polkadot:
    ```sh
    # --transfer <tokenId>,<pk>,<amount> 
    node index.js -t X,0x256077...,66
    ```
    * `X` is the example tokenId of token $X$.
    * `0x256077...` is the receive Omniverse Account. You can get the Omniverse Account by [get account](#check-the-account).
    * `66` is the amount of transferred token $X$.

* Check `balance of` Token $X$ of sender and receiver account as detailed at [Check the balance](#check-the-balance) above.  
    * Check `balance of` Token $X$ of related account on Polkadot:  
    ```sh
    # sender
    # -o, --omniBalance <tokenId>,<omniverse account>
    node index.js -o X,<o-account of sender>
    # receiver
    # -o, --omniBalance <tokenId>,<omniverse account>
    node index.js -o X,<o-account of receiver>
    ```
    * You may find outputs as follows:  
    ![img](./assets/Omniverse-transfer-1.png)  
    ![Polkadot Scan](./assets/Omniverse-transfer-1-onchain.png)  

    * Go to [EVM tools path](https://github.com/virgil2019/omniverse-evm/tree/feature-substrate-no-payload/contracts) first, and follow the tutorial to check what happened on EVM. 
    * Check `balance of` Token $X$ of related account on EVM chains:  
    * You can check the transaction on EVM chains at X [0x2fea6b82bAd2999C8Abb0C072363f86f2add5292](https://testnet.bscscan.com/address/0x2fea6b82bAd2999C8Abb0C072363f86f2add5292) and Y [0x069c23c166Edff0398958C261D3968713B21139c](https://testnet.bscscan.com/address/0x069c23c166Edff0398958C261D3968713B21139c), as follows:  
    ![img](./assets/token-X.png)  
    ![img](./assets/token-Y.png)

## Omniverse Swap Protocol
The key operation of the Omniverse Swap Protocol(OSP) is `Make exchanges`.  
* [Make exchanges](#make-exchanges)
* [Check the balance](#check-the-balance-after-exchanges)

### Make exchanges
* Swap Token X with Token Y:  
    ```sh
    # -x2y, --swapX2Y <tradingPair>,<amount>
    node index.js -x2y X2Y,100000
    ```
* Swap Token Y with Token X:  
    ```sh
    # -y2x, --swapY2X <tradingPair>,<amount>
    node index.js -y2x X2Y,100000
    ```
### Check the Balance after exchanges
* Check `balance of` Token $X$ of related account on Polkadot:  
    ```sh
    # -o, --omniBalance <tokenId>,<omniverse account>
    node index.js -o X,0x256077...
    ```

* Go to [EVM tools path](https://github.com/virgil2019/omniverse-evm/tree/feature-substrate-no-payload/contracts) first, and follow the tutorial to check what happened on EVM. 
* Check `balance of` Token $Y$ of related account on EVM chains:  
    * [Block Scan](https://testnet.bscscan.com/address/0x069c23c166Edff0398958C261D3968713B21139c)

We can found that the related states changed simultaneously both on Polkadot and EVM chains.  

## Advanced Features
We also provided some advanced features including:
- [create your own Omniverse Token](#create-your-own-omniverse-token)
- [add swap pools](#add-token-pools)

*Note that these tools are only available on Polkadot as the limitation of time. They will be easily extended to other chains and we will finish them soon.*

### Create your own Omniverse Token
![img](./assets/create-your-own-Omni-token.png)  
* `ownerPk` is the [Omniverse Account](#check-the-account) who cen be the owner of the Omniverse token to be created.
* After the creation, you can use `mint` with the operator Account of the owner to mint any amount of the new token to anyone.
    ```sh
    # --mint <tokenId>,<omniverse account>,<amount>
    node index.js -m <tokenId>,0x5a1...,<amount>
    ```
    * `tokenId` is a string naming your token.
    * `0x5a1...` is the Omniverse Account you want to mint to.
    * The last parameter is the `amount` you want to mint.
* After that, you can operate your Omniverse Token as mentioned [above](#omniverse-token-protocol).  

### Add token pools
We temporarily provided a set of very low APIs for adding token liquidity pool currently, and we will improve these APIs to be more convenient soon.  
* Generate encapsulated Omniverse Transaction data as follows:
    * Generate encapsulated data of deposit liquidity of token:  
    ```sh
    # --generateTx <tokenId>,<o-account>,<amount>
    node index.js -g shawn01,10000,shawn02,10000
    ```
    * `shawn01`, `shawn02` is a tokenId.
    * `10000` is the amount to be deposited.
    ![img](./assets/add-liquidity-2.png)  
    <p id='encapsulate' align='center'>Figure.4 Generate encapsulate data</p>  
    
    * Remember the name of token `shawn01` to be deposited(`1`)
    * Remember the amount of token `shawn01` to be deposited(`1.1`)
    * Remember the encapsulated Tx data of token `shawn01` (`1.3`)
    * Remember the name of token `shawn02` to be deposited(`2`)
    * Remember the amount of token `shawn02` to be deposited (`2.1`)
    * Remember the encapsulated Tx data of token `shawn02` (`2.3`)

* `addLiquidity` with [Polkadot.js](https://polkadot.js.org/apps/?rpc=ws%3A%2F%2F3.74.157.177%3A9944#/extrinsics)
    ![img](./assets/add-liquidity.png)  

    * `tradingPair` is a string naming the swap pool.
    *  `amountXDesired` and `amountYDesired` need to be equal to the amount when encapsulating the Tx data mentioned above.  
    * Copy data in `1.3` and `2.3` in [*Figure.4*](#encapsulate) into `tokenXData` and `tokenYData`.
