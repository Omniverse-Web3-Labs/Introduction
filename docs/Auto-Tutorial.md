# Auto-Tutorial

This guide descripes how to make omniverse operations with the omniverse CLI tools, and the code in the CLI tool is a basis for developers to build their `O-DLT` dApps.  

## Operations and Codes

Now we have created two `O-DLT` tokens by [Auto-Deployment](./Auto-Deployment.md).  

### Create Accounts

- You can create your omniverse accounts and get some gas tokens like [this](https://github.com/Omniverse-Web3-Labs/Omniverse-DLT-Introduction/tree/main/docs#omniverse-account).  

### Omniverse Transactions 

- Mint
    - [Source Code](https://github.com/Omniverse-Web3-Labs/omniverse-swap-tools/blob/8daa949015203b625abe273fc712b3d00e390fff/omniverse-helper/index.js#L181)
    - CLI:

- Transfer

### Omniverse Token Swap

- Create Token Pool

- Users deposit to the swap platform

- Users make swap from `Token-X` to `Token-Y`

- Users withdraw from the swap platform
